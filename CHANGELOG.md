# Changelog

## Unreleased

- 1.0.3: Lock background page scrolling while any native modal is open, preserving inner dialog scrolling and native close behavior. Added root/body modal-state regression coverage and bilingual Help guidance.

- 1.0.2: Standardized the header language control to EN / JA with localized target-language labels and tooltips; kept Help / Close labels and tooltips localized. Added repeated-switch regression coverage.

- Added saved-row duplication with exact stored candidates, unique localized names, capacity/storage protection, and in-dialog Undo without changing the active draw.
- Fixed unchanged or whitespace-only saved-list renames consuming the previous Undo and rewriting timestamps; case-only edits remain undoable.
- Added regression coverage for repeated/Unicode copy names, source ownership, persistence, search, failed writes, and unchanged-name Undo preservation.

- Added saved-list name search, matched/capacity counts, and identity-preserving rename.
- Reject a 31st saved list instead of silently removing an existing list.
- Require explicit same-name candidate replacement and provide replacement/rename/delete Undo inside the active saved-list dialog.
- Make saved-list writes and Undo transactional, with visible storage failures and retryable Undo.
- Guard draw and name-entry shortcuts against dialogs, unintended editable fields, key repeats, and IME composition.
- Refresh Teams summaries after source changes and Pick result controls after restoring/undoing the candidate pool; invalidate session Undo when candidates change.
- Added dependency-free regression tests and CI coverage.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-08-26

- Fixed mobile layouts so panels and mode controls fit the viewport without horizontal scrolling.
- Smoothly scrolls to the result after running Pick, Order, Teams, or Wheel on smartphones.
- Flipped the wheel pointer so it points left into the wheel.
- Added candidate-list sharing via JSON → gzip → Base64URL → URL fragment, with automatic import from shared links.
- Refined v1.0.1 mobile UX: fixed the help sheet bottom clipping, aligned the result auto-scroll to the result panel border, kept candidate status/actions on one row, and disabled candidate sharing for `file://` pages with an explanatory tooltip.
- Simplified the header meta label to “Pick · Order · Teams · Wheel” / “抽選・順番・チーム・ルーレット”.
- Stabilized the large mobile wheel so spinning no longer changes the horizontal layout width.
- Styled destructive clear actions in red and added confirmation dialogs for clearing candidates and draw history.
- Fixed the Sample button state after clearing candidates from Wheel mode.
- Changed Order copying to two result-area actions: numbered output or names-only output.
- Fixed an empty-wheel rendering exception after “Clear all” that left the Sample button disabled; wheel runs are also invalidated when the candidate list is reset.
- Removed the redundant runtime dependency count from the footer.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-08-21

- Added the initial Random Picker application on top of the single-HTML template foundation.
- Added secure one/multi-item picking with optional winner removal and a restore-and-redraw action when everyone has been selected.
- Added randomized order with list view and one-by-one presentation mode.
- Added balanced team generation by either number of teams or people per team, with live distribution preview.
- Added an animated Canvas wheel with large presentation mode.
- Added named candidate-list snapshots stored locally on the device.
- Added spreadsheet/Excel multi-column paste detection with column selection and paste-as-is fallback.
- Added mode-aware settings, result copy/share, draw history, and dedicated large-result layouts.
- Added reversible list cleanup and local persistence.
- Kept the application dependency-free and blocked runtime network access.
